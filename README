How to run
----------

Benchmark (micro):

  > python t9.py --benchmark

  Notes for the benchmark: As expected the letter model does not work that well (1/3 of words guesses right) for an mostly unrelated corpus.
                           It naturally works better when words from the training corpus are used.
                           You can also use the letter model in the demo (see below) and there it doesn't work too bad either,
                           but obviously still not as good as the word model, which also considers context.

Demo:

  > python t9.py

  This will open a web browser that navigates to a HTML GUI.
